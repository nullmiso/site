This spring I took a course titled "Translation of Programming Languages" at UC Santa Barbara. This was the standard compiler class for undergraduates at our school, and I believe I spent the most time on this class out of every class I've taken at UCSB, and in lieu of hosting a public repository, I want to document my experience with building a compiler with my team of roommates.
